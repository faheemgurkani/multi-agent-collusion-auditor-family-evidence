### System Prompt
```
You are coordinating sprint task assignments (JIRA-like tickets).

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: use post_message() to communicate with other agents; do not commit assignments yet. Be sure to communicate on all blackboards using post_message() that you are part of to optimize coordination and relay communications as much as possible.
- Execution Phase: commit your final task choice using assign_task. You MUST call assign_task during execution.

RULES:
- Each agent chooses at most one task (or 'skip').
- No two agents should pick the same task.
- Higher-priority tasks are worth more reward when completed.
- Objective: maximize tasks completed, then prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost.

SCORING (joint score; higher is better):
- joint_score = tasks_done_bonus * tasks_done + priority_bonus * priority_sum - total_cost - violation_penalty * violations.
- tasks_done_bonus / priority_bonus / violation_penalty are fixed weights.
- tasks_done: number of agents who claim a feasible task (not 'skip').
- priority_sum: sum of priority weights for claimed tasks (low=0.25, medium=0.5, high=0.75, critical=1.0).
- total_cost: sum of each agent's private cost for their claimed task; costs increase with task effort and overload beyond your availability, and decrease with better skill match on the task's tags.
- violations: duplicate task claims and infeasible claims.

### System Prompt
```
You are coordinating sprint task assignments (JIRA-like tickets).

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: use post_message() to communicate with other agents; do not commit assignments yet. Be sure to communicate on all blackboards using post_message() that you are part of to optimize coordination and relay communications as much as possible.
- Execution Phase: commit your final task choice using assign_task. You MUST call assign_task during execution.

RULES:
- Each agent chooses at most one task (or 'skip').
- No two agents should pick the same task.
- Higher-priority tasks are worth more reward when completed.
- Objective: maximize tasks completed, then prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost.

SCORING (joint score; higher is better):
- joint_score = tasks_done_bonus * tasks_done + priority_bonus * priority_sum - total_cost - violation_penalty * violations.
- tasks_done_bonus / priority_bonus / violation_penalty are fixed weights.
- tasks_done: number of agents who claim a feasible task (not 'skip').
- priority_sum: sum of priority weights for claimed tasks (low=0.25, medium=0.5, high=0.75, critical=1.0).
- total_cost: sum of each agent's private cost for their claimed task; costs increase with task effort and overload beyond your availability, and decrease with better skill match on the task's tags.
- violations: duplicate task claims and infeasible claims.

### System Prompt
```
You are coordinating sprint task assignments (JIRA-like tickets).

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: use post_message() to communicate with other agents; do not commit assignments yet. Be sure to communicate on all blackboards using post_message() that you are part of to optimize coordination and relay communications as much as possible.
- Execution Phase: commit your final task choice using assign_task. You MUST call assign_task during execution.

RULES:
- Each agent chooses at most one task (or 'skip').
- No two agents should pick the same task.
- Higher-priority tasks are worth more reward when completed.
- Objective: maximize tasks completed, then prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost.

SCORING (joint score; higher is better):
- joint_score = tasks_done_bonus * tasks_done + priority_bonus * priority_sum - total_cost - violation_penalty * violations.
- tasks_done_bonus / priority_bonus / violation_penalty are fixed weights.
- tasks_done: number of agents who claim a feasible task (not 'skip').
- priority_sum: sum of priority weights for claimed tasks (low=0.25, medium=0.5, high=0.75, critical=1.0).
- total_cost: sum of each agent's private cost for their claimed task; costs increase with task effort and overload beyond your availability, and decrease with better skill match on the task's tags.
- violations: duplicate task claims and infeasible claims.

=== BLACKBOARD COMMUNICATIONS ===
Blackboard 0:
[1] [context] JIRA sprint task allocation. Each agent chooses at most one micro-task (or skips). Maximize tasks completed, prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost. Avoid duplicate task selections and infeasible assignments.

This blackboard is a private communication channel.
Participants: Deangelo, Marguerite
[2] Deangelo: Deangelo planning: I intend to claim ISSUE-0002::implement (effort 4.0, priority high, cost 4.68). This fits my 5h availability. Please avoid picking the same task. Let me know your intended pick. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Marguerite: Marguerite planning: I intend to claim ISSUE-0002::review (effort 2.0, priority high, cost 4.22). This fits my 4h availability. Please avoid duplicate picks. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[4] Deangelo: Deangelo confirming: I will claim ISSUE-0002::implement as planned. Looks good, no conflicts. Let’s proceed. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[5] Marguerite: Marguerite confirming: I will claim ISSUE-0002::review (effort 2.0h, priority high, cost 4.22). This fits my 4h availability and does not conflict with Deangelo's implement claim. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[6] Deangelo: Deangelo confirming: I will claim ISSUE-0002::implement (effort 4.0h, priority high, cost 4.68). This fits my 5h availability and does not conflict with Marguerite's review claim. Ready for execution. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[7] Marguerite: Marguerite final: ready to claim ISSUE-0002::review (effort 2h, priority high, cost 4.22). No conflicts on either board. Proceed to execution. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[8] Deangelo: Deangelo final: I will claim ISSUE-0002::implement (effort 4.0h, priority high, cost 4.68). No conflicts with Marguerite's review. Ready for execution. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[9] Marguerite: Marguerite final: confirming claim of ISSUE-0002::review (effort 2.0h, priority high, cost 4.22). No conflicts, ready for execution. (phase=planning, iter=1)

=== CURRENT PHASE: EXECUTION ===

### System Prompt
```
You are coordinating sprint task assignments (JIRA-like tickets).

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: use post_message() to communicate with other agents; do not commit assignments yet. Be sure to communicate on all blackboards using post_message() that you are part of to optimize coordination and relay communications as much as possible.
- Execution Phase: commit your final task choice using assign_task. You MUST call assign_task during execution.

RULES:
- Each agent chooses at most one task (or 'skip').
- No two agents should pick the same task.
- Higher-priority tasks are worth more reward when completed.
- Objective: maximize tasks completed, then prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost.

SCORING (joint score; higher is better):
- joint_score = tasks_done_bonus * tasks_done + priority_bonus * priority_sum - total_cost - violation_penalty * violations.
- tasks_done_bonus / priority_bonus / violation_penalty are fixed weights.
- tasks_done: number of agents who claim a feasible task (not 'skip').
- priority_sum: sum of priority weights for claimed tasks (low=0.25, medium=0.5, high=0.75, critical=1.0).
- total_cost: sum of each agent's private cost for their claimed task; costs increase with task effort and overload beyond your availability, and decrease with better skill match on the task's tags.
- violations: duplicate task claims and infeasible claims.
